"""
A pure Python "ping" implementation, based on a rewrite by Johannes Meyer,
of a script originally by Matthew Dixon Cowles. Which in turn was derived
from "ping.c", distributed in Linux's netkit. The version this was forked
out of can be found here: https://gist.github.com/pklaus/856268

I've rewritten nearly everything for enhanced performance and readability,
and removed unnecessary functions (assynchroneous PingQuery and related).
Those of the original comments who still applied to this script were kept.

A lot was changed on my rewrite, and as far as my tests went it is working
quite beautifully. In any case, bug reports are very much welcome.

Please note that ICMP messages can only be sent by processes ran as root.

Since this was originally based on "ping.c", which a long, long time ago
was released under public domain. I will follow the Open Source mindset
and waive all rights over this script. Do whatever you want with it, just
don't hold me liable for any losses or damages that could somehow come
out of a freaking "ping" script.

Cheers and enjoy!

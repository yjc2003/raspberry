# if you need to fetch any settings from config.ini, use the get_config_option call. The first parameter is the section name in the file (should be yor instance name)

# the messageHandler method will be called by the client library when a message comes in that is destined for one of the child devices you're handling
# the first parameter is your internal id (all the mapping from ago control uuids to the internal ids is handled transparently for you)

# specify our message handler method
client.add_handler(messageHandler)

# of course you need to tell the client library about the devices you provide. The add_device call expects a internal id and a device type (you can find all valid types
# in the schema.yaml configuration file). The internal id is whatever you're using in your code to distinct your devices. Or the pin number of some GPIO output. Or
# the IP of a networked device. Whatever fits your device specific stuff. The persistent translation to a ago control uuid will be done by the client library. The
# mapping is stored as a json file in CONFDIR/uuidmap/<instance name>.json
# you don't need to worry at all about this, when the messageHandler is called, you'll be passed the internalid for the device that you did specifiy when using add_device()

# Discover the devices connected

players = squeezebox.players()

for p in players:
	print ("MAC: %s" % p['playerid'])
	client.add_device(p['playerid'], "squeezebox")

#client.add_device("MAC Address", "squeezebox")

# then we add a background thread. This is not required and just shows how to send events from a separate thread. This might be handy when you have to poll something
# in the background or need to handle some other communication. If you don't need one or if you want to keep things simple at the moment just skip this section.

# Use this to create a thread to listen for events from clients - but how??

#class testEvent(threading.Thread):
#    def __init__(self,):
#        threading.Thread.__init__(self)    
#    def run(self):
#    	level = 0
#        while (True):
#			client.emit_event("125", "event.security.sensortriggered", level, "")
#			if (level == 0):
#				level = 255
#			else:
#				level = 0
#			time.sleep (5)
#      
#background = testEvent()
#background.setDaemon(True)
#background.start()

# now you should have added all devices, set up all your internal and device specific stuff, started everything like listener threads or whatever. The call to run()
# is blocking and will start the message handling
client.run()

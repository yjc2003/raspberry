# This program is used to monitor hosts through TCP/IP ping.
# The code for this originated from the wifi_detect_device
# module written by dinki. That plugin's code originated from
# https://github.com/blackairplane/pydetect but was heavily
# modified for use with Ago Control

# Create CONFDIR/conf.d/agoping.conf

# hostaddress=8.8.8.8,192.168.1.1
# devicename=Google,router
# check_time=15
#
# *NOTE*  First host address matches first devicename, second matches
# second, etc check_time is the time (seconds) between each check

# This program is used to monitor when a wifi device joins/leaves the network
# and toggles a binary sensor based on  the device's state on the network
# This can be used to trigger events.  An example would be when a user's mobile phone
# connects then turn on lights.
#
# The code for this originated from https://github.com/blackairplane/pydetect
# but was heavily modified for use with Ago Control
# 
# Create CONFDIR/conf.d/wifi_device_detect.conf
# [wifi_device_detect]
# phoneaddress=AA:00:BB:11:CC:22,33:DD:44:EE:55:FF
# devicename=androidphone,iphone
# wait_time=15
# check_time=15
#
# *NOTE*  First phone address (MAC Address) matches first devicename, second matches second, etc
#         wait_time is the maximum time (minutes) a device can be inactive before being marked as away
#         check_time is the time (seconds) between each check

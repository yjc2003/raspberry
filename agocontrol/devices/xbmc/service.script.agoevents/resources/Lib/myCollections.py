    histlist
    
    The history list (histlist) is a list that tracks the history of a 
    value. The history list can also notify when the value is changed,
    This is referred to as a step. There are two kinds of steps that can
    be tracked. A regular step (value is changed) and a delayed step. A 
    delayed step requires that the value be changed a specified amount of
    consecutive times.
    
    On initialization, the hist list class requires either a set of initial
    conditions of a single value that will be set for all the initial 
    conditions. If a single value is given, 4 steps of history will be
    tracked.  If initial conditions are given, one step will be tracked for
    each entry in the array of initial conditions.
